Hello everyone! Welcome to my page about food. I like cooking and eating in addition 
  to being a UX designer. On this page, I discuss why I adore baking and cooking, how this
  adventure got started, Will show you some decent images of some of the items I've done so
  far and my process so you can see how this has affected my life! <br>
  
  I've exclusively focused on cooking delicious cuisine for the past two years. I have dedicated 
  time to understanding the precise proportions of spices, sweetness, and other ingredients that 
  give food a little more flavor. But now that I know that, I'll attempt to concentrate on making 
  these recipes a little bit healthier. I always feel more content to eat flavorful food when there 
  are healthy alternatives. I intend to concentrate on modifying recipes during the next five years.
