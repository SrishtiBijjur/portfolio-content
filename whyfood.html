    My UG in CSE and relevant internship experiences gave me a strong technical hold and an understanding of 
    product life-cycle development. The concepts of computer science were never enough to answer all the questions 
    on my mind. Human-computer interaction has become broader than CSE itself. This intersection of design and technology
    is where I thrive. I have made conscious and constant efforts to make myself a better problem solver via unique learning 
    experiences. I work to understand the needs of the stakeholders, I use inclusive and participatory design approaches wherever 
    necessary and always focus on improving accessibility. While thereâ€™s a gazillion problem spaces where  UX can play a vital role, 
    accessibility for older adults is of keen interest to me. <br>

    In my free time when I'm not hacking away, you can find me in an apron 
    cooking or baking (usually deserts cause that's my forte ! ). Constant appreciations and requests for my recipes lead to creation 
    of my very own Instagram page with my cousin sister.
